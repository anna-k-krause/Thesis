## Motivation
I wanted to provide a broad data analysis of Nebraka Inmates, who they were, what their crimes were, and the data trends among them. 

## Build status
The project are currently still in the refining process and are missing some notation.

## Tech/framework used
I used Python through Jupyter Notebooks to do these projects.

## Features
I was able to incorporate Pandas, Seaborn, and Numpy for analysis and visualization for this project.

## Contribute

You can contribute and use your own analysis methods!
